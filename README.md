## Todo

- I have doubts the keyboard shortcuts work on windows, I don't own a computer like that
- Editor bar should always be in view
- Indent the ul and ol list via css a bit
- Auto save every minute to five minutes
- Unsaved indicator

This was part of an experiment I did in planning and delivering applications quickly and I feel this was a highly successful and useful proejct.
